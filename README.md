# 3D Ops Marketing Site (React + Vite)

Industrial, responsive, and SEO‑minded marketing site starter for 3D Ops.

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Structure
- `src/styles/3dops.css` — custom CSS (industrial theme)
- `src/pages/*` — route pages (Home, Services, Work, About, Contact)
- `src/components/*` — UI building blocks (Hero, CardGrid, ContactForm, Stat)
- `public/images/*` — SVG placeholder art you can replace with part photos
- `public/robots.txt`, `public/sitemap.xml`, `index.html` — SEO basics

## Notes
- Contact form is front‑end only. Wire it to your backend or a form service.
- All imagery here is SVG we generated to ensure it runs offline. Replace with your own photos or royalty‑free images later.
